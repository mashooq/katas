# Chess Kata 

When Bishops see each other they move to the opposite sides of the board.

Given the initial positions (in chess notation) of two bishops, bishop1 and bishop2, calculate their future positions. Keep in mind that bishops won't move unless they see each other along the same diagonal.

Example
For bishop1 = "d7" and bishop2 = "f5", the output should be ["c8", "h3"].
